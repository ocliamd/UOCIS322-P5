# UOCIS322 - Project 5 #
Brevet time calculator with AJAX and MongoDB!

## Overview

Controle open and close times are calculated by dividing the controle distance by the maximum and minimum speeds, the formula used was given for this website: https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator. This time calculated is then rounded to the nearest minute.

Each brevet distance has predetermined closing times. Thus, controles greater than the brevet distance get no additional time as the closing time is now based on the brevet.

## Update 

We have taken Project 4 and added a database that stores the values unsing the Submit button and the input table is cleared. Then the user is given a message to click the Display button which redicts you to a new HTML page where the inputted values are displayed. It also displays the distance as well as where it begins at.
